## Description

Check Yo’ Self is a fruits classification and detection system that aims to improve the process of self-serve checkouts. Often times shoppers find it difficult to scan items without barcodes, most commonly, fruits. Given a picture of a fruit, Check Yo’ Self aims to accurately classify the type and detect the quantity of fruits within the picture, and subsequently add the correct charge to the shopper’s receipt. Check Yo’ Self accomplishes this by utilizing the power of neural networks and deep learning for image classification, and OpenCV for object detection and localization of the fruits within an image.
