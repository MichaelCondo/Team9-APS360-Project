# Description

Given a picture of a fruit, Check Yo’ Self aims to accurately classify the type and quantity of fruits within the picture, and subsequently the app will add the correct charge to the shopper’s receipt. Check Yo’ Self will make this task more efficient, by leveraging neural networks for the image classification problem. Modern image classification neural networks such as AlexNet and ResNet have shown great results when classifying images. ResNet has also surpassed the accuracy of a human [2]. Therefore, machine learning is an appropriate tool for this task.
